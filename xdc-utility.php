                <p>The XDC token is the underlying utility token that powers XinFin's Hybrid Blockchain. The XDC token acts as a settlement mechanism for DApps built on the XinFin Hybrid Blockchain.<!-- XinFin has also launched an Ethereum token called XDCE that can be traded with XDC utility token at a 1:1 ratio. This gives the token holder flexibility to hold tokens in either form for utility. The ERC-20 token can be swapped for the XDC token at a ratio of 1:1. This swap can be facilitated on the AlphaEx exchange. AlphaEx is compatible with all decentralised exchanges and has a presence in liquidity markets and supports XDC liquidity.</p>-->
                <p>To date, use cases built around XinFin's XDC utility token are: MyContract, TradeFinex, Kramaa, Land Registry, iFactor, Blockdegree and TurantPay.</p>

            <p class="date">InFactor places the Supplier, Buyer and Financer on the same platform allowing visibility and real time communication between all parties. In order to factor an invoice, the Supplier will upload their invoice details on the platform which the Buyer must verify. Approved invoices are then visible to all the Financers registered on the platform. Financers can  send factoring proposals to any verified invoice they choose. Suppliers can then choose to accept any proposal submitted by a Financer. All Users are provided with a built-in XDC wallet with ERC20 standards. Discounting logic is prebuilt in the smart contract which automatically calculates interest, prepayment and post payment amounts based on the factoring terms.</p>
